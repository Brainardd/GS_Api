ClinicMind is the #1 EHR and practice management system for chiropractic clinics in the U.S.—and we’re just getting started.

We exist to fight back against the bloated, confusing, and often predatory systems that make healthcare harder than it should be. Insurance companies profit by delaying care, denying claims, and overwhelming providers with red tape. We're building software that helps practices beat them at their own game—so clinicians can focus on healing, not billing.

Thousands of practices already rely on us to thrive. Now, we’re expanding into mental health and general medicine, bringing our bold mission and proven tools to new providers across the country.

To do that, we need to tell our story better. We need a powerful web presence and marketing engine—one that resonates with purpose-driven practitioners and pushes the industry forward.

And that’s where you come in.

The Role

We’re hiring a Web & Marketing Designer to lead the redesign of ClinicMind.com and own the look and feel of our entire marketing experience—from social campaigns and email templates to digital ads, landing pages, and event materials.

This is more than a production role. It’s an opportunity to shape how the world sees a company that’s taking on one of the biggest challenges in healthcare—and winning.

You’ll be the sole Marketing Designer, collaborating closely with our Head of Design (focused on Product), while owning the end-to-end creative execution for Marketing. You’ll conduct research, define strategy, explore bold ideas, and bring it all to life with polished, conversion-minded design.

If you're a web designer with strong visual instincts, CMS fluency, and you want your design work to matter in the real world—to patients, providers, and an entire industry—this is your moment.

What You’ll Do
• Redesign ClinicMind.com: Own the full website redesign—from research and discovery to IA, prototyping, visual design, testing, and delivery. Your work will support brand awareness, customer conversion, and market expansion.
• Execute Marketing Creative: Design campaign assets, landing pages, social media graphics, event collateral, email templates, digital ads, and more.
• Champion Research: Conduct user and stakeholder research, synthesize insights, and translate them into actionable creative strategies.
• Evolve the Brand: Help refine and extend our visual identity to ensure brand consistency across all marketing and digital touchpoints.
• Collaborate with Teams: Work closely with Marketing, Product, and Sales to ensure creative alignment with business goals.
• Own the Craft: Deliver polished, thoughtful work that’s grounded in design thinking, brand systems, and user needs.

What We’re Looking For
• 3–5+ years of professional experience as a web or marketing designer
• Strong portfolio of responsive web designs, visual design work, and branded marketing assets
• Proficiency in Figma and a major design suite (Adobe CC, Affinity, etc.)

Thinking Machines is a technology consultancy building AI & data platforms to solve high-impact problems for our clients. Our vision is a future where data-driven decision-making is a norm and where AI is used to support humans in making excellent decisions. To do that, we create data cultures, one organization at a time.

We’re a company made up of intellectually curious, civic-minded, forever-learning individuals. We believe that great data science products are built with care for people and that the best way to drive inclusive innovation is to start with a diverse team.

Our field of work is incredibly dynamic, so we want to work with people who are committed to growing with us. We want to hire people who can demonstrate an ability to learn, then provide personalized coaching, growth opportunities, and a great working environment to get them to world-class.

Role Description

Data science ain’t data science without data. As a Data Engineer, you will collect and consolidate data from various sources, secure them and transform them into useful forms so that you and your team can work data science magic on them. From a security perspective, we work with many confidential datasets, so make sure that Eve and Trudy don't get their grubby paws on them.

You will be responsible for building systems for collecting, transforming, and storing data. This can range from writing a short script that periodically calls an API, to creating a website scraper, to architecting and building a complete data collection and data warehousing system.

On a normal day, you might be architecting an analytics platform for a SaaS company, debugging a data ETL pipeline for an international NGO, and optimizing then deploying a machine learning model to TensorFlow mobile.

You'll be expected to help out on engineering tasks that may come up in any department. Since the tech space can get crazy, we are looking for someone who is up for any kind of challenge and has the initiative to seek out ways to be useful. We move fast, and we expect you to keep up!

Role Requirements

We’re looking for someone who has:
• 3+ years of work experience in a data engineering or software engineering role.
• Proficiency in Python programming language and SQL — Postgres is our favorite flavor of RDBMS, but you have to be ready to use tools such as dbt, BigQuery, and Snowflake. You must be very comfortable with writing and explaining code.
• Experience managing various cloud environments — Especially IaaS such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Bonus points if you love MS Azure!
• Experience working with Google and/or Azure stack — Big points if you’re comfortable with BigQuery, Dataflow, TensorFlow, Azure Data Factory, Databricks and other similar tools. More bonus points if you know how to handle data that doesn’t fit your machine’s RAM!
• Security-conscious mindset — Handling client data is part of our daily job. We have security guidelines and protocols in place but a single blunder can cost huge damage.
• Ability to make or build things fast — Time is our most precious resource. You can always throw money at things to make them faster but that’s not very engineer-y.
• Demonstrated mentorship and/or project leadership experience — Alongside technical expertise, you’ll mentor junior engineers and foster a culture of learning and growth. You’ll guide team members through project tasks, offer constructive feedback, and support their development.
• Strong communication skills — You’ll be explaining things during most conversations either internal or external. Therefore, you need to know how to phrase yourself to be understandable depending on who you’re talking to. You will collaborate with external clients and internal teams alike, helping the team hit project targets efficiently and fill in any knowledge gaps, all while adhering to best practices. Documenting your code is a given, and you also need to write technical documentation in the form of manuals, proposals, guidelines, etc.
• Consultative mindset — Beyond technical skills, this role involves working closely with clients to understand their challenges, guide them through solutions and provide strategic recommendations or, when necessary, gently realign expectations. You'll build trust by listening actively, asking the right questions, and offering clear, actionable insights that drive the best results.
• Generalist point of view — You are someone eager to explore roles and opportunities beyond data engineering. We’re seeking an engineering consultant with strong technical expertise and attention to detail, who can dive into the nitty-gritty while also connecting the dots to see the bigger picture and drive strategic outcomes.
• Initiative — Sometimes, the team won’t know that they need you. You need to be aware about the projects people are working on and support when applicable.

Ideal candidates have:
• People management experience — Ensuring the well-being of your juniors, and helping them set meaningful development goals while staying on track to achieve them
• People management or project leadership aspirations — Actively looking for opportunities get into or working on stepping into people management or project leadership

Benefits and Perks

We offer the following compensation and benefits:
• Competitive salary — the compensation amount is positively correlated with the difficulty of the job, relevant experience, fit, and skill factors.
• Hybrid Set-Up — Hybrid-remote means employees are required to come in an average of two days a week for client engagements and internal in-person days intended for collaboration, socials, and strategic planning.
• Individual professional development budget — an annual budget for conferences, training courses, books, and software is available to sharpen your skills and build new ones to help you grow in your role.
• Full health benefits — generous health insurance package upon hiring, with options to include dependents.
• Apprenticeship and yearly performance reviews with the leadership team to discuss career and personal goals, job progress and any questions and concerns."

ClinicMind is the #1 EHR and practice management system for chiropractic clinics in the U.S.—and we’re just getting started.

We exist to fight back against the bloated, confusing, and often predatory systems that make healthcare harder than it should be. Insurance companies profit by delaying care, denying claims, and overwhelming providers with red tape. We're building software that helps practices beat them at their own game—so clinicians can focus on healing, not billing.

Thousands of practices already rely on us to thrive. Now, we’re expanding into mental health and general medicine, bringing our bold mission and proven tools to new providers across the country.

You’ll be the sole Marketing Designer, collaborating closely with our Head of Design (focused on Product), while owning the end-to-end creative execution for Marketing. You’ll conduct research, define strategy, explore bold ideas, and bring it all to life with polished, conversion-minded design.

If you're a web designer with strong visual instincts, CMS fluency, and you want your design work to matter in the real world—to patients, providers, and an entire industry—this is your moment.

What You’ll Do
• Redesign ClinicMind.com: Own the full website redesign—from research and discovery to IA, prototyping, visual design, testing, and delivery. Your work will support brand awareness, customer conversion, and market expansion.
• Execute Marketing Creative: Design campaign assets, landing pages, social media graphics, event collateral, email templates, digital ads, and more.
• Champion Research: Conduct user and stakeholder research, synthesize insights, and translate them into actionable creative strategies.
• Evolve the Brand: Help refine and extend our visual identity to ensure brand consistency across all marketing and digital touchpoints.
• Collaborate with Teams: Work closely with Marketing, Product, and Sales to ensure creative alignment with business goals.
• Own the Craft: Deliver polished, thoughtful work that’s grounded in design thinking, brand systems, and user needs.

What We’re Looking For
• 3–5+ years of professional experience as a web or marketing designer

Our vision is a future where data-driven decision-making is a norm and where AI is used to support humans in making excellent decisions. To do that, we create data cultures, one organization at a time.

Our field of work is incredibly dynamic, so we want to work with people who are committed to growing with us. We want to hire people who can demonstrate an ability to learn, then provide personalized coaching, growth opportunities, and a great working environment to get them to world-class.

Role Description

Data science ain’t data science without data. As a Data Engineer, you will collect and consolidate data from various sources, secure them and transform them into useful forms so that you and your team can work data science magic on them. From a security perspective, we work with many confidential datasets, so make sure that Eve and Trudy don't get their grubby paws on them.

You will be responsible for building systems for collecting, transforming, and storing data. This can range from writing a short script that periodically calls an API, to creating a website scraper, to architecting and building a complete data collection and data warehousing system.

On a normal day, you might be architecting an analytics platform for a SaaS company, debugging a data ETL pipeline for an international NGO, and optimizing then deploying a machine learning model to TensorFlow mobile.

You'll be expected to help out on engineering tasks that may come up in any department. Since the tech space can get crazy, we are looking for someone who is up for any kind of challenge and has the initiative to seek out ways to be useful. We move fast, and we expect you to keep up!

Role Requirements

We’re looking for someone who has:
• 3+ years of work experience in a data engineering or software engineering role.
• Proficiency in Python programming language and SQL — Postgres is our favorite flavor of RDBMS, but you have to be ready to use tools such as dbt, BigQuery, and Snowflake. You must be very comfortable with writing and explaining code.
• Experience managing various cloud environments — Especially IaaS such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Bonus points if you love MS Azure!
• Experience working with Google and/or Azure stack — Big points if you’re comfortable with BigQuery, Dataflow, TensorFlow, Azure Data Factory, Databricks and other similar tools. More bonus points if you know how to handle data that doesn’t fit your machine’s RAM!
• Security-conscious mindset — Handling client data is part of our daily job. We have security guidelines and protocols in place but a single blunder can cost huge damage.
• Ability to make or build things fast — Time is our most precious resource. You can always throw money at things to make them faster but that’s not very engineer-y.
• Demonstrated mentorship and/or project leadership experience — Alongside technical expertise, you’ll mentor junior engineers and foster a culture of learning and growth. You’ll guide team members through project tasks, offer constructive feedback, and support their development.
• Strong communication skills — You’ll be explaining things during most conversations either internal or external. Therefore, you need to know how to phrase yourself to be understandable depending on who you’re talking to. You will collaborate with external clients and internal teams alike, helping the team hit project targets efficiently and fill in any knowledge gaps, all while adhering to best practices. Documenting your code is a given, and you also need to write technical documentation in the form of manuals, proposals, guidelines, etc.
• Consultative mindset — Beyond technical skills, this role involves working closely with clients to understand their challenges, guide them through solutions and provide strategic recommendations or, when necessary, gently realign expectations. You'll build trust by listening actively, asking the right questions, and offering clear, actionable insights that drive the best results.
• Generalist point of view — You are someone eager to explore roles and opportunities beyond data engineering. We’re seeking an engineering consultant with strong technical expertise and attention to detail, who can dive into the nitty-gritty while also connecting the dots to see the bigger picture and drive strategic outcomes.
• Initiative — Sometimes, the team won’t know that they need you. You need to be aware about the projects people are working on and support when applicable.

Ideal candidates have:
• People management experience — Ensuring the well-being of your juniors, and helping them set meaningful development goals while staying on track to achieve them
• People management or project leadership aspirations — Actively looking for opportunities get into or working on stepping into people management or project leadership

Benefits and Perks

We offer the following compensation and benefits:
• Competitive salary — the compensation amount is positively correlated with the difficulty of the job, relevant experience, fit, and skill factors.
• Hybrid Set-Up — Hybrid-remote means employees are required to come in an average of two days a week for client engagements and internal in-person days intended for collaboration, socials, and strategic planning.

ClinicMind is the #1 EHR and practice management system for chiropractic clinics in the U.S.—and we’re just getting started.

We exist to fight back against the bloated, confusing, and often predatory systems that make healthcare harder than it should be. Insurance companies profit by delaying care, denying claims, and overwhelming providers with red tape. We're building software that helps practices beat them at their own game—so clinicians can focus on healing, not billing.

Thousands of practices already rely on us to thrive. Now, we’re expanding into mental health and general medicine, bringing our bold mission and proven tools to new providers across the country.

To do that, we need to tell our story better. We need a powerful web presence and marketing engine—one that resonates with purpose-driven practitioners and pushes the industry forward.

And that’s where you come in.

The Role

We’re hiring a Web & Marketing Designer to lead the redesign of ClinicMind.com and own the look and feel of our entire marketing experience—from social campaigns and email templates to digital ads, landing pages, and event materials.

This is more than a production role. It’s an opportunity to shape how the world sees a company that’s taking on one of the biggest challenges in healthcare—and winning.

You’ll be the sole Marketing Designer, collaborating closely with our Head of Design (focused on Product), while owning the end-to-end creative execution for Marketing. You’ll conduct research, define strategy, explore bold ideas, and bring it all to life with polished, conversion-minded design.

If you're a web designer with strong visual instincts, CMS fluency, and you want your design work to matter in the real world—to patients, providers, and an entire industry—this is your moment.

What You’ll Do
• Redesign ClinicMind.com: Own the full website redesign—from research and discovery to IA, prototyping, visual design, testing, and delivery. Your work will support brand awareness, customer conversion, and market expansion.
• Execute Marketing Creative: Design campaign assets, landing pages, social media graphics, event collateral, email templates, digital ads, and more.
• Champion Research: Conduct user and stakeholder research, synthesize insights, and translate them into actionable creative strategies.
• Evolve the Brand: Help refine and extend our visual identity to ensure brand consistency across all marketing and digital touchpoints.
• Collaborate with Teams: Work closely with Marketing, Product, and Sales to ensure creative alignment with business goals.
• Own the Craft: Deliver polished, thoughtful work that’s grounded in design thinking, brand systems, and user needs.

What We’re Looking For
• 3–5+ years of professional experience as a web or marketing designer
• Strong portfolio of responsive web designs, visual design work, and branded marketing assets
• Proficiency in Figma and a major design suite (Adobe CC, Affinity, etc.)
• Deep understanding of layout, typography, color, and hierarchy

Thinking Machines is a technology consultancy building AI & data platforms to solve high-impact problems for our clients. Our vision is a future where data-driven decision-making is a norm and where AI is used to support humans in making excellent decisions. To do that, we create data cultures, one organization at a time.

We’re a company made up of intellectually curious, civic-minded, forever-learning individuals. We believe that great data science products are built with care for people and that the best way to drive inclusive innovation is to start with a diverse team.

Our field of work is incredibly dynamic, so we want to work with people who are committed to growing with us. We want to hire people who can demonstrate an ability to learn, then provide personalized coaching, growth opportunities, and a great working environment to get them to world-class.

Role Description

Data science ain’t data science without data. As a Data Engineer, you will collect and consolidate data from various sources, secure them and transform them into useful forms so that you and your team can work data science magic on them. From a security perspective, we work with many confidential datasets, so make sure that Eve and Trudy don't get their grubby paws on them.

You will be responsible for building systems for collecting, transforming, and storing data. This can range from writing a short script that periodically calls an API, to creating a website scraper, to architecting and building a complete data collection and data warehousing system.

On a normal day, you might be architecting an analytics platform for a SaaS company, debugging a data ETL pipeline for an international NGO, and optimizing then deploying a machine learning model to TensorFlow mobile.

You'll be expected to help out on engineering tasks that may come up in any department. Since the tech space can get crazy, we are looking for someone who is up for any kind of challenge and has the initiative to seek out ways to be useful. We move fast, and we expect you to keep up!

Role Requirements

We’re looking for someone who has:
• 3+ years of work experience in a data engineering or software engineering role.
• Proficiency in Python programming language and SQL — Postgres is our favorite flavor of RDBMS, but you have to be ready to use tools such as dbt, BigQuery, and Snowflake. You must be very comfortable with writing and explaining code.
• Experience managing various cloud environments — Especially IaaS such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Bonus points if you love MS Azure!
• Experience working with Google and/or Azure stack — Big points if you’re comfortable with BigQuery, Dataflow, TensorFlow, Azure Data Factory, Databricks and other similar tools. More bonus points if you know how to handle data that doesn’t fit your machine’s RAM!
• Security-conscious mindset — Handling client data is part of our daily job. We have security guidelines and protocols in place but a single blunder can cost huge damage.
• Ability to make or build things fast — Time is our most precious resource. You can always throw money at things to make them faster but that’s not very engineer-y.
• Demonstrated mentorship and/or project leadership experience — Alongside technical expertise, you’ll mentor junior engineers and foster a culture of learning and growth. You’ll guide team members through project tasks, offer constructive feedback, and support their development.
• Strong communication skills — You’ll be explaining things during most conversations either internal or external. Therefore, you need to know how to phrase yourself to be understandable depending on who you’re talking to. You will collaborate with external clients and internal teams alike, helping the team hit project targets efficiently and fill in any knowledge gaps, all while adhering to best practices. Documenting your code is a given, and you also need to write technical documentation in the form of manuals, proposals, guidelines, etc.
• Consultative mindset — Beyond technical skills, this role involves working closely with clients to understand their challenges, guide them through solutions and provide strategic recommendations or, when necessary, gently realign expectations. You'll build trust by listening actively, asking the right questions, and offering clear, actionable insights that drive the best results.
• Generalist point of view — You are someone eager to explore roles and opportunities beyond data engineering. We’re seeking an engineering consultant with strong technical expertise and attention to detail, who can dive into the nitty-gritty while also connecting the dots to see the bigger picture and drive strategic outcomes.
• Initiative — Sometimes, the team won’t know that they need you. You need to be aware about the projects people are working on and support when applicable.

Ideal candidates have:
• People management experience — Ensuring the well-being of your juniors, and helping them set meaningful development goals while staying on track to achieve them
• People management or project leadership aspirations — Actively looking for opportunities get into or working on stepping into people management or project leadership

Benefits and Perks

We offer the following compensation and benefits:
• Competitive salary — the compensation amount is positively correlated with the difficulty of the job, relevant experience, fit, and skill factors.
• Hybrid Set-Up — Hybrid-remote means employees are required to come in an average of two days a week for client engagements and internal in-person days intended for collaboration, socials, and strategic planning.
• Individual professional development budget — an annual budget for conferences, training courses, books, and software is available to sharpen your skills and build new ones to help you grow in your role.
• Full health benefits — generous health insurance package upon hiring, with options to include dependents.
• Apprenticeship and yearly performance reviews with the leadership team to discuss career and personal goals, job progress and any questions and concerns."

You don’t just write software—you build AI-driven systems that make traditional engineering look sluggish and inefficient. If that sounds like you, keep reading.

Most software teams are still writing code the old way—manual debugging, trial-and-error deployments, and features that barely leverage AI beyond a sprinkle of Copilot suggestions. Trilogy is different. Every part of our development process is infused with AI: feature ideation, bug detection, defect resolution, and performance optimization. This isn’t about dabbling in AI tools; this is about fully integrating AI into the software lifecycle to eliminate waste, ship faster, and build with precision.

In this role, you will take existing B2B products, break them down, rebuild them as cloud-native applications, and optimize them with AI at every level. You’ll be developing and deploying AI-powered features, using cutting-edge retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for automated defect detection, and ensuring every release is smooth—zero outages, zero disruptions, zero excuses. If you're looking for a job where you spend weeks debating architecture decisions instead of shipping, this isn’t it.

If you’re ready to push the boundaries of AI-driven software engineering and accelerate your career into high-scale cloud-native development, apply now. If you prefer sticking to what you already know, writing test cases by hand, or working in teams that are afraid of automation, this isn’t for you.

What you will be doing
• Using analysis tools and RAG vector stores to identify, diagnose, and correct product defects and fix bugs.
• Leveraging AI development agents to design, develop, and deploy innovative features for cloud-native applications.
• Collaborating with a global team to deliver high-quality, enterprise-grade solutions.

What you won’t be doing
• Routine Monotony: We keep cumbersome infrastructure tasks to a minimum so you can focus on creating innovative solutions.
• Endless Meetings: We value your expertise in development over sitting in meeting rooms. Expect more coding, less talking.

AI-First Software Engineer II key responsibilities
• Implement AI-driven features to streamline workflows and empower service providers with innovative tools.

Basic Requirements
• 4+ years of professional experience in commercial software development, focusing on production code for server-side web applications
• Experience using GenAI code assistants (e.g., Github Copilot, Cursor, v0.dev)
• A willingness to use GenAI in your day-to-day development work

You don’t just write software—you build AI-driven systems that make traditional engineering look sluggish and inefficient. If that sounds like you, keep reading.

Most software teams are still writing code the old way—manual debugging, trial-and-error deployments, and features that barely leverage AI beyond a sprinkle of Copilot suggestions. Trilogy is different. Every part of our development process is infused with AI: feature ideation, bug detection, defect resolution, and performance optimization. This isn’t about dabbling in AI tools; this is about fully integrating AI into the software lifecycle to eliminate waste, ship faster, and build with precision.

In this role, you will take existing B2B products, break them down, rebuild them as cloud-native applications, and optimize them with AI at every level. You’ll be developing and deploying AI-powered features, using cutting-edge retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for automated defect detection, and ensuring every release is smooth—zero outages, zero disruptions, zero excuses. If you're looking for a job where you spend weeks debating architecture decisions instead of shipping, this isn’t it.

If you’re ready to push the boundaries of AI-driven software engineering and accelerate your career into high-scale cloud-native development, apply now. If you prefer sticking to what you already know, writing test cases by hand, or working in teams that are afraid of automation, this isn’t for you.

What you will be doing
• Using analysis tools and RAG vector stores to identify, diagnose, and correct product defects and fix bugs.
• Leveraging AI development agents to design, develop, and deploy innovative features for cloud-native applications.
• Collaborating with a global team to deliver high-quality, enterprise-grade solutions.

What you won’t be doing
• Routine Monotony: We keep cumbersome infrastructure tasks to a minimum so you can focus on creating innovative solutions.
• Endless Meetings: We value your expertise in development over sitting in meeting rooms. Expect more coding, less talking.

AI-First Software Engineer II key responsibilities
• Implement AI-driven features to streamline workflows and empower service providers with innovative tools.

Basic Requirements
• 4+ years of professional experience in commercial software development, focusing on production code for server-side web applications
• Experience using GenAI code assistants (e.g., Github Copilot, Cursor, v0.dev)
• A willingness to use GenAI in your day-to-day development work

ClinicMind is the #1 EHR and practice management system for chiropractic clinics in the U.S.—and we’re just getting started.

We exist to fight back against the bloated, confusing, and often predatory systems that make healthcare harder than it should be. Insurance companies profit by delaying care, denying claims, and overwhelming providers with red tape. We're building software that helps practices beat them at their own game—so clinicians can focus on healing, not billing.

Thousands of practices already rely on us to thrive. Now, we’re expanding into mental health and general medicine, bringing our bold mission and proven tools to new providers across the country.

To do that, we need to tell our story better. We need a powerful web presence and marketing engine—one that resonates with purpose-driven practitioners and pushes the industry forward.

And that’s where you come in.

The Role

We’re hiring a Web & Marketing Designer to lead the redesign of ClinicMind.com and own the look and feel of our entire marketing experience—from social campaigns and email templates to digital ads, landing pages, and event materials.

This is more than a production role. It’s an opportunity to shape how the world sees a company that’s taking on one of the biggest challenges in healthcare—and winning.

You’ll be the sole Marketing Designer, collaborating closely with our Head of Design (focused on Product), while owning the end-to-end creative execution for Marketing. You’ll conduct research, define strategy, explore bold ideas, and bring it all to life with polished, conversion-minded design.

If you're a web designer with strong visual instincts, CMS fluency, and you want your design work to matter in the real world—to patients, providers, and an entire industry—this is your moment.

What You’ll Do
• Redesign ClinicMind.com: Own the full website redesign—from research and discovery to IA, prototyping, visual design, testing, and delivery. Your work will support brand awareness, customer conversion, and market expansion.
• Execute Marketing Creative: Design campaign assets, landing pages, social media graphics, event collateral, email templates, digital ads, and more.
• Champion Research: Conduct user and stakeholder research, synthesize insights, and translate them into actionable creative strategies.
• Evolve the Brand: Help refine and extend our visual identity to ensure brand consistency across all marketing and digital touchpoints.
• Collaborate with Teams: Work closely with Marketing, Product, and Sales to ensure creative alignment with business goals.
• Own the Craft: Deliver polished, thoughtful work that’s grounded in design thinking, brand systems, and user needs.

What We’re Looking For
• 3–5+ years of professional experience as a web or marketing designer
• Strong portfolio of responsive web designs, visual design work, and branded marketing assets
• Proficiency in Figma and a major design suite (Adobe CC, Affinity, etc.)
• Deep understanding of layout, typography, color, and hierarchy
• Mastery of CMS tools like Webflow, Framer, or WordPress
• Strong grasp of responsive design, accessibility standards, and design systems

Fella Health helps middle-aged men live 10 years longer.

We're the telemedicine clinic that understands bigger guys. We start by solving their most pressing healthcare need through GLP-1 medication, then stay with them for the long haul. Think of us less as a weight loss company and more as a life transformation partner.
Where are we now?
• We’ve grown >1000x since Aug 2021, >180x since Sept 2022, >10x since Nov 2023.
• We’ve just surpassed $30M ARR.

The opportunity as Web Designer

As a Web Designer at Fella Health, you’ll design and develop high-converting landing pages and quiz funnels. This role is focused on execution, not brand creation — you’ll be implementing visual assets into performance-first designs that directly impact results. You’ll work closely with our CRO Specialist and Lead Designer to create landing pages that can be adapted across multiple brands. While we currently use Webflow as our primary platform, we’re also exploring a move to Shopify or other platforms — so being able to implement front end code and use no-code tools at the same time is important .

You’ll receive fast, direct feedback and will be expected to iterate quickly. We’re looking for someone who can move fast, take ownership, and consistently deliver high-converting pages.

Over time, you'll become a key player in the development of new customer journeys, working hand-in-hand with the rest of the team to create designs that significantly improve our Lead > Sale conversion rate.

This is a full-time remote role.

You'll report directly to our Lead Designer (@Marjoe Bacus), CRO Specialist (@Emiliano), work closely with Frontend Engineer (@Art), Head of Growth (Dave Lane) & CEO (Richie Cartwright).

Key Responsibilities
• Straight away
• Design for core conversions
• Collaborate: Work closely with the design team and the CRO Specialist to understand the optimization roadmap and identify design opportunities across funnels.
• Design: Create visually appealing and user-centric designs, focusing on improving page layouts, visual hierarchy, and calls to action to lift conversion rates.
• Iterate: Based on test results and insights from the CRO Specialist, iterate on designs to further optimize performance and implement winning variants across the site.
• Enhance design systems for testing - Develop and maintain design components and templates that facilitate efficient testing and ensure consistency across the site.
• In the near future
• Expand design's impact on the customer journey - Collaborate with the Ore, our CRO Specialist to design optimized experiences beyond the site, including ads, email, and product flows. You'll create visually compelling and persuasive designs that influence core KPIs e.g. CAC & LTV.

Need to Have
• Design expertise: 3+ years of experience designing high performing landing pages and websites for existing brands and startups (not template or concept works) and a portfolio that showcases this. Skilled in creating visually compelling and user-centric designs that effectively guide users towards desired actions.
• Proficiency in design and web development tools: Strong command of design tools such as Figma, Webflow, or Adobe Creative Suite.
• Webflow and No-code tools: Experience with building websites using webflow and understand front-end development and able to implement custom code.
• Collaboration skills: Proven ability to work closely with Design, CRO, Product, Marketing, and Engineering teams to understand optimization goals and translate them into impactful designs.
• Full funnel design perspective: Understanding of how design impacts the entire customer journey, from awareness to retention. Ability to create cohesive and persuasive experiences across touchpoints.
• Attention to detail: Meticulous in ensuring design consistency, adhering to brand guidelines, and maintaining design systems across the site and various touchpoints.

Nice to Have
• Previous experience with CRO: Familiarity with conversion rate optimization principles and techniques. Experience designing for A/B and multivariate tests is a strong plus.
• Storytelling through design: Skilled at using visual design to communicate complex ideas and guide users through narratives that drive conversions.
• Adaptability: Thrives in a fast-paced environment. Able to quickly iterate on designs based on changing requirements and new insights. Experience with Shopify and able to use other no-code tools and graphic design skills are a plus.

Our cultural standards

These are the core cultural standards to which we hold ourselves & our team-members at Fella:
• Belief in the mission: We will have served 10 million patients by the end of 2028 and we transform the life of most patients who join. We have a lot of work to do. We are obsessed with our patients and are dedicated to the mission.
• Unwavering integrity: We are at the frontier, so we often live in ambiguity with no trodden path. When we can’t look to others for guidance, we must maintain impeccable ethics and unwavering integrity.
• Only the paranoid survive: Bad sh*t is coming. By joining us, you’re choosing to sail straight towards the storms with unhesitating conviction. However much we’ve already done, however far we’ve already come — it’s still Day 1 and all our work is ahead of us.
• Your life’s work: This will be your most challenging, most rewarding role of your life. You’ll be shocked how capable you are & how much you can achieve.
• If we’re average we fail: We are only interested in “insanely great”, a focus on the quality of our execution that in everyday life would be considered pathological. We have a dedication to excellence and reject incompetence.
• Commitment to candor: That which can be destroyed by the truth should be. You get full transparency from the company and the company expects full transparency from you. We never say anything about someone that we wouldn’t say to them directly. We give feedback with love and do not need to protect people from fleeting physical sensations.
• A maniacal sense of urgency: We execute at an intensity that most people think is impossible. Speed is critical and we need things done yesterday. We all work very hard and in such a competitive world there really is no other way to win.
• Enduring frugality: We are frugal. We hate being wasteful and we are anti-luxury. A culture of cheapness keeps us young. We spend our cash wisely & carefully — in a way that would make our grandmas proud.
• Bulldozing barriers: The world is malleable and we shape it. We truly believe this and act accordingly. We are relentlessly resourceful and are at the mercy of no-one but ourselves.
• Keep your head down: We’re boring people doing exciting work. We don’t chase short-term status — we ignore short-term dopamine hits and focus on what matters. Outsiders will underestimate us and we revel in that.
• The power of focus: We live in a world of power laws and we cannot overestimate the unimportance of practically everything. Know your One Thing, and nail it.

🎯 “You just build a fing amazing experience. Make each step amazing. Make every decision in the long term interest of the customer. Give the customer massively more value than you take.”*

Compensation & Benefits
• Compensation: $30k-$60k/yr inc equity
• Healthcare: comprehensive medical insurance (if appropriate)
• Vacation: PTO with a yearly minimum (≥2wks/yr + local national holidays)
• Remote: our team is fully distributed across the world and functions fully remotely
• Personal development: budget for books, courses, coaching
• Personal wellness: budget for gym, health apps
• Coaching: free biweekly health coaching

Thinking Machines is a technology consultancy building AI & data platforms to solve high-impact problems for our clients. Our vision is a future where data-driven decision-making is a norm and where AI is used to support humans in making excellent decisions. To do that, we create data cultures, one organization at a time.

We’re a company made up of intellectually curious, civic-minded, forever-learning individuals. We believe that great data science products are built with care for people and that the best way to drive inclusive innovation is to start with a diverse team.

Our field of work is incredibly dynamic, so we want to work with people who are committed to growing with us. We want to hire people who can demonstrate an ability to learn, then provide personalized coaching, growth opportunities, and a great working environment to get them to world-class.

Role Description

Data science ain’t data science without data. As a Data Engineer, you will collect and consolidate data from various sources, secure them and transform them into useful forms so that you and your team can work data science magic on them. From a security perspective, we work with many confidential datasets, so make sure that Eve and Trudy don't get their grubby paws on them.

You will be responsible for building systems for collecting, transforming, and storing data. This can range from writing a short script that periodically calls an API, to creating a website scraper, to architecting and building a complete data collection and data warehousing system.

On a normal day, you might be architecting an analytics platform for a SaaS company, debugging a data ETL pipeline for an international NGO, and optimizing then deploying a machine learning model to TensorFlow mobile.

You'll be expected to help out on engineering tasks that may come up in any department. Since the tech space can get crazy, we are looking for someone who is up for any kind of challenge and has the initiative to seek out ways to be useful. We move fast, and we expect you to keep up!

Role Requirements

We’re looking for someone who has:
• 3+ years of work experience in a data engineering or software engineering role.
• Proficiency in Python programming language and SQL — Postgres is our favorite flavor of RDBMS, but you have to be ready to use tools such as dbt, BigQuery, and Snowflake. You must be very comfortable with writing and explaining code.
• Experience managing various cloud environments — Especially IaaS such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Bonus points if you love MS Azure!
• Experience working with Google and/or Azure stack — Big points if you’re comfortable with BigQuery, Dataflow, TensorFlow, Azure Data Factory, Databricks and other similar tools. More bonus points if you know how to handle data that doesn’t fit your machine’s RAM!
• Security-conscious mindset — Handling client data is part of our daily job. We have security guidelines and protocols in place but a single blunder can cost huge damage.
• Ability to make or build things fast — Time is our most precious resource. You can always throw money at things to make them faster but that’s not very engineer-y.
• Demonstrated mentorship and/or project leadership experience — Alongside technical expertise, you’ll mentor junior engineers and foster a culture of learning and growth. You’ll guide team members through project tasks, offer constructive feedback, and support their development.
• Strong communication skills — You’ll be explaining things during most conversations either internal or external. Therefore, you need to know how to phrase yourself to be understandable depending on who you’re talking to. You will collaborate with external clients and internal teams alike, helping the team hit project targets efficiently and fill in any knowledge gaps, all while adhering to best practices. Documenting your code is a given, and you also need to write technical documentation in the form of manuals, proposals, guidelines, etc.
• Consultative mindset — Beyond technical skills, this role involves working closely with clients to understand their challenges, guide them through solutions and provide strategic recommendations or, when necessary, gently realign expectations. You'll build trust by listening actively, asking the right questions, and offering clear, actionable insights that drive the best results.
• Generalist point of view — You are someone eager to explore roles and opportunities beyond data engineering. We’re seeking an engineering consultant with strong technical expertise and attention to detail, who can dive into the nitty-gritty while also connecting the dots to see the bigger picture and drive strategic outcomes.
• Initiative — Sometimes, the team won’t know that they need you. You need to be aware about the projects people are working on and support when applicable.

Ideal candidates have:
• People management experience — Ensuring the well-being of your juniors, and helping them set meaningful development goals while staying on track to achieve them
• People management or project leadership aspirations — Actively looking for opportunities get into or working on stepping into people management or project leadership

Benefits and Perks

We offer the following compensation and benefits:
• Competitive salary — the compensation amount is positively correlated with the difficulty of the job, relevant experience, fit, and skill factors.
• Hybrid Set-Up — Hybrid-remote means employees are required to come in an average of two days a week for client engagements and internal in-person days intended for collaboration, socials, and strategic planning.
• Individual professional development budget — an annual budget for conferences, training courses, books, and software is available to sharpen your skills and build new ones to help you grow in your role.
• Full health benefits — generous health insurance package upon hiring, with options to include dependents.
• Apprenticeship and yearly performance reviews with the leadership team to discuss career and personal goals, job progress and any questions and concerns."
